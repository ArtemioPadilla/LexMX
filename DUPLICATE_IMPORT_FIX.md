# Duplicate Import Fix Summary

## Issue
**SyntaxError**: Identifier 'setupWebLLMProvider' has already been declared in `corpus-selector-journey.test.ts`

## Root Cause
The file had two separate import statements from the same source (`test-helpers-consolidated`):
1. Line 1: `import { expect, setupWebLLMProvider, test } from '../utils/test-helpers-consolidated';`
2. Lines 8-11: Another import block with `setupWebLLMProvider` (duplicate)

This happened when the import update script ran earlier - it didn't properly consolidate multiple import blocks from the same source.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed the immediate issue
Consolidated all imports into a single statement:
```typescript
import { 
  expect, 
  test,
  setupWebLLMProvider,
  navigateAndWaitForHydration
} from '../utils/test-helpers-consolidated';
```

### 2. Created prevention script
Created `scripts/fix-duplicate-imports.js` to:
- Detect duplicate imports from the same source
- Consolidate them automatically
- Prevent future occurrences

## Verification
- ✅ No syntax errors when listing tests
- ✅ All 15 test files checked for duplicate imports
- ✅ corpus-selector-journey.test.ts now has clean imports

## Result
The test suite can now run without syntax errors. All imports are properly consolidated and no duplicate declarations exist.
